## About Me

A passionate aspiring full-stack developer based in Hyderabad, India, with a strong foundation in Java and a drive to build robust and scalable applications. My interests lie in crafting efficient back-end systems and engaging modern front-end experiences.

I'm currently focused on mastering the synergy of Spring Boot and React with Vite to develop high-performance and user-friendly solutions. I'm also actively exploring the power of Redis for caching and Solr for advanced search capabilities, alongside my expertise in MySQL.

## What You'll Find Here

This GitHub profile is a reflection of my coding journey, featuring projects and explorations in:

* **Java & Spring Boot Back-end:** Repositories showcasing RESTful APIs, data handling, and architectural patterns using Java, Spring, and Spring Boot.
* **React & Vite Front-end:** Projects demonstrating modern and efficient user interface development with React, accelerated by Vite.
* **Data Management & Caching:** Implementations and experiments with MySQL for relational data and Redis for in-memory caching solutions.
* **Search Functionality:** Integration and utilization of Solr to build powerful and relevant search features.
* **[Add Other Relevant Areas Here - e.g., Algorithms, Personal Projects, Contributions to Open Source]**
